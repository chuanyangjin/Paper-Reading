# Paper Reading
[This repository](https://github.com/chuanyangjin/Paper-Reading) contains my reading notes for some impressive papers in recent years in computer vision (e.g. MoCo, ViT, DALLÂ·E 2), natural language processing (e.g., BERT, GPT-3), and multimodal learning (e.g., CLIP, ViLT), as well as other trending topics.
